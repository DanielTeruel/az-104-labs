# Lab 02b – Manage Governance with Azure Policy (AZ-104)

Notes and documentation for Lab 02b of AZ-104.

## Overview
This lab focuses on implementing governance in Azure using **Azure Policy**, **resource tagging**, and **resource locks**.  
The goal was to enforce organizational standards, improve cost tracking, and protect resources from accidental changes.

## Business Scenario
After a recent audit, the organization identified multiple Azure resources without proper ownership or cost information.  
To address this, governance controls were implemented to enforce and remediate resource tagging and to protect critical resources using locks.

## What I Learned
- How to enforce mandatory tags using Azure Policy
- How to remediate non-compliant resources automatically
- How tag inheritance works at the resource group level
- How resource locks prevent deletion and modification
- The importance of consistent tag naming for policy enforcement
