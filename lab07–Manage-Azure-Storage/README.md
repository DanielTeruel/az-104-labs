# Lab 07 – Manage Azure Storage (AZ-104)

Notes and documentation for Lab 07 of AZ-104.

## Overview
In this lab, I worked with **Azure Storage** to create and configure storage accounts, secure blob and file storage, manage lifecycle policies, control network access, and test authentication mechanisms such as SAS tokens.

The objective was to explore how Azure Storage can be secured, optimized for cost, and integrated into a governance and networking strategy.

## Business Scenario
The organization stores a large amount of data that is not frequently accessed and wants to reduce storage costs by using lower-cost access tiers.  
At the same time, it is necessary to secure access to data using network restrictions, authentication mechanisms, and immutable storage policies, and to evaluate Azure Files as a replacement for on-premises file shares.

## What I Learned
- How to create and secure Azure Storage Accounts
- How to configure lifecycle management rules for cost optimization
- How to work with private blob containers and immutable storage
- How to use SAS tokens for controlled access to blobs
- How to create and manage Azure File shares
- How to restrict storage access using virtual networks and service endpoints
