# Lab 03 – Manage Azure Resources by using Azure Resource Manager Templates (AZ-104)

## Overview
The lab focused on deploying managed disks in Azure and covered:
- Creating and exporting ARM templates
- Editing templates and redeploying resources
- Using Azure Cloud Shell with PowerShell and Bash for deployments
- Deploying resources using Bicep templates
- Verifying deployments and resource configurations

This exercise provides hands-on experience with infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices, improving deployment consistency and reducing human errors.

## Business Scenario
The organization aims to simplify and standardize resource deployments in Azure. By automating deployments with ARM and Bicep templates, teams can reduce administrative overhead, ensure consistent configurations, and deploy resources quickly across environments.
