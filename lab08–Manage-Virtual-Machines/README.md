# Lab 08 – Manage Virtual Machines (AZ-104)

Notes and documentation for Lab 08 of AZ-104.

## Overview
In this lab, I worked with **Azure Virtual Machines** to create, configure, and manage standalone VMs and **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**.  
The lab covers deploying VMs across **Availability Zones**, scaling compute and storage resources, configuring auto-scaling rules, and creating VMs using **Azure Portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI**.

The objective was to explore how Azure Virtual Machines can be deployed, scaled, and automated in a real-world scenario while ensuring high availability and efficiency.

## Business Scenario
The organization wants to evaluate different strategies to deploy virtual machines in Azure.  
First, individual virtual machines are deployed across **Availability Zones** to achieve high availability with a 99.99% SLA.  
Then, a **Virtual Machine Scale Set** is created to automatically scale resources based on CPU usage metrics, optimizing performance and cost.

## What I Learned
- How to create virtual machines across Availability Zones for high availability  
- How to resize VMs and add data disks for vertical scaling  
- How to configure and manage Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)  
- How to create autoscaling rules based on CPU metrics  
- How to deploy VMs using **PowerShell** and **Azure CLI**  
- How to monitor VM status and deallocate resources to reduce costs
