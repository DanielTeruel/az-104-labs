# Lab 02 – Manage Subscriptions and RBAC (AZ-104)

Notes and scripts for Lab 02 of AZ-104.

## Overview
This lab focuses on managing Azure subscriptions and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Management Groups.  
The goal was to apply the principle of least privilege while centralizing access management.

## Business Scenario
A centralized Help Desk team is responsible for managing virtual machines and creating support requests, but they cannot register new Azure resource providers.

## What I Learned
- Role assignments are done at a scope
- Permissions are not assigned directly to users
- Subscription-level RBAC affects all resource groups
