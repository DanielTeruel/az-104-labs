- Governance and compliance (Management Groups, Azure Policy, Tags, Locks)
- Core Azure services (Virtual Machines, Storage)
- High availability, scalability, and cost optimization
- Hands-on experience using **Azure Portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI**

All labs are structured to simulate **real enterprise scenarios**, not just exam theory.
